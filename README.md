System Architecture:

Frontend (React): User Interface: Develop a user-friendly UI for image uploading and displaying results. User Authentication: Implement user authentication for secure access.

Backend (Node.js):

⦁Image Handling: Receive and store uploaded images temporarily. Initiate communication with ML models.

⦁ML Model Communication: Use an asynchronous mechanism to communicate with ML models (consider using libraries like Axios). Implement a fault-tolerant algorithm to route requests to available ML models. Manage timeouts and retries for fault tolerance.

⦁Response Processing: Handle responses from ML models. Convert ML responses into a meaningful JSON format.

⦁API Endpoints: Design API endpoints for frontend communication.
